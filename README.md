# Frontend Coding Challenge

This is an AngularJS / ReactJS + HTML / CSS coding challenge. This task is divided in 3 parts. First 2 are mandatory and 3rd part is a bonus task. Put your code on Github and submit a repository link. 

## 1. Implement Responsive Design using Bootstrap or Foundation

1. Implement design of `Dashboard.jpg` attached using Bootstrap or Foundation. Cards data is provided in `cards.json` attached
2. The design should be responsive down to iPhone 5. You are not provided mobile designs. Please implement responsive design according to your own intuition
3. Design and implement Campaigns selection dropdown (List of campaigns is provided in `campaigns.json` attached

_Pending, Search, Data buttons do not need to be functional_


What we are looking for:

* Attention to detail. Please make the desktop design as close to provide JPG as possible
* HTML structure
* Structure for CSS classes
* Your own design sense

## 2. Implement Functionality of Campaigns Filter in AngularJS 2.0 or ReactJS

User should be able to filter cards shown based on the selected campaign. Dropdown should also provide "All Campaigns" selection which should show all campaigns. Please implement a component based structure (as opposed to directives in AngularJS). Use campaign ID field in `cards.json` and `campaigns.json` to correlate cards with selected campaign. The rest of fields on the card need not to be functional. 

What we are looking for:

* Sense of App structure in AngularJS 2.0 / ReactJS
* JavaScript coding style and structure

## 3. (Bonus) Implement basic NodeJS express server

Instead of hardcoding `campaigns.json` and `cards.json` in frontend, put them at backend and write API's to fetch campaigns dropdown data and cards from backend. 

What we are looking for:

* RESTful use of API's
* Usage of API's in AngularJS 2.0 / React JS
